## ⚠️ Action Required - You Must Complete

### 1. Replace Placeholder Information

- [ ] Replace `[Your Email Address]` with your actual email address in all files (can be any email you use - Gmail, GitHub email, etc.)
- [ ] Replace `[Your Address]` with your address (see options below)
  - **Option 1:** Full address (most compliant)
  - **Option 2:** PO Box (privacy-friendly, GDPR compliant)
  - **Option 3:** Virtual business address (available in Netherlands)
  - **Option 4:** City and country only (may work for very small operations, but verify with a lawyer)
- [ ] Note: You don't need a Data Protection Officer (DPO) unless you process large amounts of data or special categories

### 2. Customize for Your Business
- [ ] Review and customize data collection sections to match what you actually collect
- [ ] Specify exact data retention periods based on your business needs
- [ ] List actual third-party services you use (Google Analytics, payment processors, etc.)
- [ ] Update cookie types to match what you actually use
- [ ] Specify if you transfer data outside EEA and what safeguards you use

### 3. Technical Implementation
- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** Implement a cookie consent banner that:
  - Blocks non-essential cookies until consent is given
  - Allows users to accept/reject different cookie categories
  - Stores consent preferences
  - Allows users to withdraw consent
- [ ] Ensure privacy policy and cookie policy are easily accessible (footer links, etc.)
- [ ] Add privacy policy link in app stores (required for App Store and Google Play)

### 4. Legal Review
- [ ] **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED:** Have a Dutch/EU lawyer review these documents
- [ ] Consider registering terms and conditions with KVK (Netherlands Chamber of Commerce)
- [ ] Review if you need additional policies (e.g., EULA for mobile apps)

### 5. Business Registration (If Applicable)
- [ ] If you're operating as a business (even as a sole proprietor), you may need to register with KVK (Kamer van Koophandel) in the Netherlands
- [ ] If registered, include your KVK registration number in legal documents
- [ ] Note: As an individual developer, you may not need KVK registration if you're not running a formal business
