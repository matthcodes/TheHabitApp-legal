## 🚀 GitHub Pages Setup

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
3. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Branch**: `main` (or `master`)
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**
5. Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/[repository-name]/`

   For example, if your repository is `TheHabitApp-legal` and your username is `matthcodes`, 
   your site will be at: `https://matthcodes.github.io/TheHabitApp-legal/`

### Step 2: Custom Domain (Optional - Skip if not needed)

If you later want to use a custom domain, you can:
1. Purchase a domain
2. Create a `CNAME` file in the repository root with your domain
3. Configure DNS with your domain provider
4. Update GitHub Pages settings to use your custom domain

## 📝 Customization

### Update Contact Information

Edit the following files and replace placeholder text:
- `privacy-policy.html` - Update name, email and address in section 13
- `terms-and-conditions.html` - Update email and address in section 13
- `cookie-policy.html` - Update email and address in section 9

### Update Personal Information

Search and replace:
- `[Your Name]` with your actual name
- `[Your Email Address]` with your actual email address (can be a Gmail, GitHub email, or any email you use)
- `[Your Address]` - **Address options:**
  - **Full address** (recommended for GDPR compliance)
  - **PO Box** (privacy-friendly alternative)
  - **Virtual business address** (available in Netherlands)
  - **City and country only** (may be acceptable for very small operations, but check with a lawyer)
  
  **Note:** GDPR generally requires a contact address, but you can use privacy-friendly alternatives like a PO Box or virtual address instead of your home address.

### Styling

Modify `css/style.css` to match your brand colors and design preferences.
